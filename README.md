# Deep learning based Image Compression for Microscopy Images

## Introduction
This repo is the code base for the paper: **Deep learning based Image Compression for Microscopy Images: An Empirical Study**

The submodule `CompressAI` is forked from [CompressAI](https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI) and adapted to the grayscale and 2/3D microscopy images.

## Reproducibility

You can go to [this folder](paper/paper_exp) and try out our jupyter notebooks for both 2D and 3D tasks.

We will release the pretrained models and dataset to Zenodo.
